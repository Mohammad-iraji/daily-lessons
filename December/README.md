#CSS Grid
1.Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. Unlike **Flexbox** (which is primarily one-dimensional — either a row or a column), Grid lets you control layout in both rows and columns.
*This feature prevents you from using too many properties and keeps your code clean

2.When to use Grid?
-Ultimately you decide where to use it.
---
3.**Core concepts and terminology** (very important):
-The grid must be applied to a container (such as a div) for it to work
 - display: grid; or display: inline-grid; — creates a grid formatting context
 -Grid items: the direct children of the grid container.
 -grid-template-rows — defines row tracks
 -grid-template-columns — defines column tracks
 -Grid gap: space between rows/columns (row-gap, column-gap)
 ---
 4.Essential container properties
 *display: grid;
 *grid-template-columns: <track-size> ...; — defines columns. Examples: 1fr 2fr 100px, repeat
 *fr means “fractional unit” — a portion of the free available space
